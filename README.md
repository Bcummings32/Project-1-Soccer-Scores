# User Story

```
As a user I want to be able to:
Input my favorite team/player and see their stats
Find out when they will be playing
See recent high lights from past games
Save my favorite teams/players so their information automatically is displayed when the app is launched
I MIGHT also want to see:
News articles related to the players/teams
```

# Process

```
The app was designed through a collaborative effort. The team utilized GitHub to store the repository and maintain version control. The app offers a mobile-first design. The technology used for our projects is as follows:

APIs - two (one fully operational)
Framework - BULMA, JS, Json, Ajax, and Jquery cdn
Client-side storage to store persistent data
Tasks(primarily) but limited
HTMI/ CSS (Ella)
APIs/Ajax/ Local Storage (Patrick, Chris)
JS/Jquery (Ben)
Challenges
Debugging
Coding (scripts, Ajax, storage)
Writing coding to display from Ajax requests
Github - setting up branches
Success
Planning to include comfort levels
Task assignments
Collaboration (braining storming)
Github - (pushing, merging)
Group/ Individual breakout rooms
```
